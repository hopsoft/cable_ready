# Installation

{% hint style="success" %}
If you're running [StimulusReflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com) or other CableReady-powered libraries \(such as [Optimism](https://optimism.leastbad.com/) or [Futurism](https://github.com/julianrubisch/futurism)\), CableReady is already installed as a dependency and you can move on to [Setup](setup.md#setup). ðŸŽ‰
{% endhint %}

CableReady has both client \([npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cable_ready)\) and server \([Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/cable_ready)\) components which need to be installed. It is vitally important that you **make sure that your server and client versions match exactly**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
There can be issues with conflicting versions introduced when we're testing a pre-release build, since yarn will typically install the most recent package available, while Rubygems will install the last official release. ðŸ¤¯
{% endhint %}

```bash
bundle add cable_ready
yarn add cable_ready
```

You can manually tweak and/or lock the versions you want to install by modifying `Gemfile` and `package.json` respectively, then re-running `bundle install && yarn install`.

## ActionCable

CableReady depends on the [ActionCable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) framework \(installed by default as part of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)\) to handle sending data to the client over websockets. You must have ActionCable installed on both the client and server... and it will be unless you've disabled it.

You can check your `package.json` to verify that `@rails/actioncable` is installed. If you have trouble with ActionCable, consider [verifying that it's installed correctly](troubleshooting/#verify-actioncable).

## Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/download) for everything: caching, sessions, jobs and yes, ActionCable. Redis is a dependency for StimulusReflex; the installation task sets up Redis for ActionCable's [subscription adapter](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html#subscription-adapter) in the development environment.

While Redis in development is not mandatory for standalone CableReady use, we do recommend it:

{% code title="Gemfile" %}
```ruby
gem "redis", ">= 4.0", :require => ["redis", "redis/connection/hiredis"]
gem "hiredis"
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="config/cable.yml" %}
```yaml
development:
  adapter: redis
  url: <%= ENV.fetch("REDIS_URL") { "redis://localhost:6379/1" } %>
  channel_prefix: your_application_development
```
{% endcode %}

## Rails 5.2

The CableReady documentation assumes that you are running Rails 6.x. It is possible to use CableReady with Rails 5.2, but you must make some adjustments to your configuration.

1. Replace `actioncable` with `@rails/actioncable` in `package.json`
   * `yarn remove actioncable`
   * `yarn add @rails/actioncable`
2. Replace any instance of `import Actioncable from "actioncable"` with `import { createConsumer } from "@rails/actioncable"`
   * This imports the `createConsumer` function directly
   * Previously, you might call `createConsumer()` on the `Actioncable` import: `Actioncable.createConsumer()`
   * Now, you can reference `createConsumer()` directly

## Polyfills for IE11

If you need to provide support for older browsers, you can `yarn add @cable_ready/polyfills` and include them **before** your Stimulus controllers \(if any\) and CableReady channels:

{% code title="app/javascript/packs/application.js" %}
```javascript
// other stuff
import '@cable_ready/polyfills'
import 'channels'
import 'controllers'
```
{% endcode %}
